# Code Documentation Guide

Good documentation is crucial for maintaining a healthy codebase. It helps other developers (and your future self) understand the code's purpose, how it works, and how to use it.

This guide will walk you through the best practices for documenting your TypeScript/Next.js project.

## Why Document Your Code?

- **Improved Readability:** Well-documented code is easier to read and understand.
- **Easier Maintenance:** When you or someone else needs to fix a bug or add a feature, good documentation makes the process much faster.
- **Better Collaboration:** Documentation helps team members work together more effectively.
- **Onboarding New Developers:** New team members can get up to speed much faster with a well-documented codebase.

## Documentation Standard: TSDoc

For TypeScript projects, the recommended standard for inline documentation is [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/). It's a formal specification for documenting TypeScript code, using JSDoc-style comments.

### Basic Syntax

TSDoc comments start with `/**` and end with `*/`. They are placed directly above the code they are documenting.

### Documenting a Function

Here's an example of how to document a simple function:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
 *
 * @param a - The first number.
 * @param b - The second number.
 * @returns The sum of the two numbers.
 */
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

**Key TSDoc tags used here:**

- `@param`: Describes a parameter of the function.
- `@returns`: Describes the return value of the function.

### Documenting a React Component

Here's how you might document a React component:

```typescript
import React from 'react';

/**
 * Props for the Greeting component.
 */
interface GreetingProps {
  /** The name to display in the greeting. */
  name: string;
}

/**
 * A simple component that displays a greeting.
 *
 * @param props - The props for the component.
 * @returns A React element.
 */
const Greeting: React.FC<GreetingProps> = ({ name }) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
};

export default Greeting;
```

## Generating Documentation with TypeDoc

While TSDoc comments are great for reading in the code, you can also use them to generate a full HTML documentation website for your project. The most popular tool for this is [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/).

### Next Steps

1.  **Install TypeDoc:** We will install TypeDoc as a development dependency.
2.  **Configure TypeDoc:** We will add a script to your `package.json` to run TypeDoc.
3.  **Generate Documentation:** You will be able to run a command to generate the documentation website.

Let's start by adding this guide to your project. Then we'll proceed with setting up TypeDoc.
